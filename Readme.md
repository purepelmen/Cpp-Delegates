# Cpp-Delegates (AKA C#-like delegates in C++)
Cpp-Delegates is a single-header file mini-library.
Written by me. Use it the way you want. It's not licensed, so no need to attribute the author.

## Files
`delegate.hpp` - library header, that's all you may need.

`main.cpp` - executable code example that tests the library.
